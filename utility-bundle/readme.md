## The utility bundle ##

Some of the macros on this page require a utility bundle to function properly.
It consists in a handful of methods and a `MalisMacros` window object that serve in various steps of the macro execution.
Bundling these functions together cuts down on needless copy-pasting, making each macro more compact and efficient.

While each macro comes with a minified copy of this bundle, you only ever need <b>one</b>, meaning you can delete subsequent copies if you are using multiple macros.
